# Project Final By Defri
The following are the results of the project I worked on while taking the training course at TripleTen. Project Final covered:

* Perform exploratory data analysis.
* Define user segmentation based on purchase history. Feel free to implement your ideas regarding user segmentation. Consider how your segmentation can help you develop more personalized offers for different users. Try to form segmentation based on what users buy. You can analyze their purchases and group the items purchased based on their product categories.
* Formulate and conduct statistical hypothesis testing.

This project is about how to identify customers based on their profile, what they bought a thing, and how often they visits E-Commerce' pages every day.
